### Python Project:
# Customer Membership

This project is the final project of Pacmann's Basic Python Programming course. In this project, I was asked to create a simple program for the E-Commerce platform, PacCommerce. There are 3 tiers in PacCommerce, namely Platinum, Gold and Silver. Each of these tiers has different benefits, which are as follows:

## Case Description
PacCommerce wants to create a system to predict user membership based on monthly expense and monthly income of each user.

For this prediction, PacCommerce uses a distance-based approach using **Euclidean Distance**. Members are selected based on the closest distance to the input.

## Objective
Create a feature that allows users to do the following:
1. View all tiers and memberships available in PacCommerce
2. Show the monthly cost and required monthly income for each membership 3.
3. Predicts which membership a user belongs to based on expense and income parameters
4. Calculate the final total expense based on the PacCommerce membership level 4.
